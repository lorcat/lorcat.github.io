Let's start with the lines from JJ Cale.
One of my favorite songs of his, makes me fill wonder - what am I and where am I..

<pre>
Yes, I used to know a fellow
He was lighter on his feet
Just as quick as a sparrow
That was the former me
Since I been here for so long now
Now I think that I can see
Acquaint myself with that fellow
Who was the former me
Those days have been lost in my mind
A fancy man, I won't deny
</pre>
